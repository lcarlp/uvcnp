    Script to change nurse fields from 'cpedersen' to 'smorgan'.
    -- There are four new fields in V3 that are filled in automatically
    -- with the nurse's username using REDCap feature: @READONLY @USERNAME
    -- On July 12-15, I filled them all in with 'cpedersen', not knowing for
    -- sure who the actual nurse was and not willing to hunt through the log
    -- to determine it.
    -- We had a legal case in Lyme where Sharon Morgan needed her name to
    -- appear in the extracted PDF, so I wrote this script to make that happen
    -- for one client.
    
    This script could be used as a starting point for similar or more extensive work.

    Fill in several @READONLY nurse and date fields that I missed during the go-live on July 12.  These were causing bogus "Save your changes?" warnings.  Details below:
    
    ---------- Forwarded message ---------
    From: L Carl Pedersen <lcarlp@gmail.com>
    Date: Wed, Jul 29, 2020 at 10:48 AM
    Subject: REDCap Technical Note: Save your changes?
    To: Sarah Jo Brown <sjbrownvt@gmail.com>, Laurie Harding <lharding0625@gmail.com>, Janet Hunt <janet@uvcnp.org>
    
    This note is a little less technical than most of the ones I've sent.  Poking around in V3, I noticed that even if I just look at a record, I often get this message:
    
    [Omitted screenshot of "Save your changes?" warning dialog.]
    
    Why do I get this message if I did not make changes?  The main reason is related to a small mistake I made during the V3 upgrade, which I have now corrected.
    I added new creation-date fields in several places, and I added fields that record which nurse created the record.  These values cannot be manually entered.  They are filled in automatically when the record is created.  Alas, they are also filled in automatically in existing records if they are empty, and I failed to fill all of them in on July 12.  
    So, the nurse looks at an existing record, the blank field gets filled in and not the record is (technically) modified.... leading to the annoying warning message.
    So, I just filled in all the missing values.  The creation date for records created before the V3 go-live is hard to determine, so it is filled in as July 12, 2020, and I filled in 'cpedersen' as the identity of the creator.   Since some towns have had nurse changes and some currently have more than one nurse, it can be hard to tell who really created the record.  
    But, we'll have correct data for all new records going forward.  There have already been a number of new records created.

    Several bug corrections, some done during the upgrade and some not until today.
    
    1) Apparently || is higher priority in expressions than +, so I needed to use parentheses when concatenating sums.  Fixed during upgrade.
    
    2) Make sure encounter_type__10, "Other" is selected if there are any notes, so they show. Fixed during upgrade.
    
    3) Add in some old V2 notes fields to the encounter_progress_notes.  Requested by Cindy.  Done today.
    
    4) Added else clauses to some of the case statements, since otherwise if they return null, concatenating the null will cause the entire expression to be null.  This is different from what I was used to with Oracle, which would treat a null like an empty string, but that was non-standard behavior.  Also done today.
    
    As a result of the last two changes, I re-imported the encounters and the problem list files into REDCap.

    old_records_lyme is a poorly named field that contains a file with old "Version 1" data for clients who existed at the time (late 2018?), one file for each client.
    
    I moved that field to the new version 3 profile mainly at the request of Cindy Grigel, the Thetford Community Nurse.  It's at the very end, labeled "Old Version 1 Records", so that it will still be available when we switch to Version 3 (scheduled for July 12, 2020).
    
    I wonder how hard it was to create/upload those files.  Perhaps I could do the same thing for some of the Version 2 data?

    Corrected error made weeks ago, where I effectively got rid of the "date_1st_contact" field in V3 by creating a new field with the same name.  Luckily, simply adding the field back with its original definition, but in the profile_v2 form, caused the associated data to reappear in the database.
    
    I wonder if I made any other mistakes like this.  If so, I hope they are as easy to correct.

    Added some entries to the primary_referrer list, and revised descriptions some of the existing ones.  Note that the numbering on these is quite different from the numbering for referred_by in V2.  That seems OK since, for one thing, the old items were checkboxes and these are radio buttons, and also the list has changed so much that it would be hard to compare V2 to V3 anyway.

    Removed multi-byte characters and Byte Order Mark
    
    REDCap apparently added the BOM when we added the multi-byte characters by copying and pasting from a Word document.  Now that those characters have been removed, it appears that we can upload without the BOM and when we download it is still not there.  I think it's better to keep it this way for simplicity.  I (or some successor) might have a different opinion in the future.

    Downloads of the Data Dictionary from REDCap have had slightly different quoting.  This makes no functional difference, but it is easier to track chages when the quoting matches.

    Improved aag1_social_context view, many cosmetic changes...
    
    ... changed most occurrences of 100 to 100. since most of the calculations should use reals.  Many of those changes were not really needed.

    Re-enable slow code, fix formatting and type bug.
    
    Removed /***/ comment delimiters to re-enable the slower parts of the code.  Fixed some minor indenting problems.  Enforced type on sort_key for aag1_temp1 table because otherwise, the output was coming in the wrong order.

    Fixed Missing data bug in aag1_discharge_outcome1
    
    1 in (...) did not work as it was.  Could have quoted the '1', but decided to use a sum instead since I used that elsewhere.
    
    Also elided zero rows.

    Changed month table to a month view in the glance script.
    
    Did this mainly to get everything in one place.
    for some reason, this change required casting strftime('%m',d.first) to int in order for the join to work.

    More views plus a tempoary table.  Worked the first time I ran it... to my own amazement.  Numbers are very close to Bob's.  Took a lot of analysis to get there, though.

    Minor formatting changes.
    
    Changed to use ".width 0" after more carefully readin SQLite3 documentation, because it automatically chooses a wide width based on the data.  Also, go into list mode instead of csv mode at the end.  I think that will be better.

    Add Living Will/DPOAH query

    Add new file for static(?) tables.
    
    So, far, just one table in here, containing names of months for date formatting, but other tables could well go here, e.g. the date range table and the table of towns, although the latter will not have static contents.

    Breakdown client encounters by type.
    
    Several new queries using the revised encounter view.  Numbers are very close to what Bib Rufsvold got.  They are a little higher, maybe because of additional data and maybe also because I am counting mutliple encounter methods.

    Refactored aag1_encounter_all view
    
    Re-written view view takes into account that the user might select more than one method for a contact, and we mostly count each selected method as a different encounter.  Despite this complex change, the counts only changed slightly, which is a very good thing!
