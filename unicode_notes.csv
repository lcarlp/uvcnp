Multi-byte Unicode example:

Below 18.5 Underweight   18.5 – 24.9 Normal or Healthy Weight >25.0 – 29.9 Overweight      > 30.0 Obese
                      ^ ^     ^                                     ^                ^ ^ ^
The 5 marked characters that look like spaces are non-breaking spaces, two bytes:  c2 a0
The 2 marked characters that look like dashes are en dashes: three bytes: e2 80 93

A tentative theory is that REDCap replaced the en dashes with normal single-byte dashes,
but at the time of this writing, that needs to be confirmed.  

Also, it looks like maybe the Byte Order Mark (BOM) was added when we added the en dash,
but that also needs to be confirmed.
