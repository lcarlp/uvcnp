-- Clarifications:
--     â€¢	The Client Problems, Nurse Interventions, and Nurse-Reported Outcomes in this report are based on information entered into the Upper Valley Community Nurse Projectâ€™s Electronic Documentation System used by your community/parish nurse. Importantly,Â Client ProblemsÂ do not represent the prevalence of these conditions in the larger community; rather, they profile the clients served by your community or parish nurse.

--     â€¢	The data reported here is based upon UVCNP Electronic Documentation Project input from October 15, 2018 to July 11, 2019 (38 weeks). Utilization of the system to document client care (40-60% of clients for most forms) affects the data analysis and reported findings cannot be generalized to the nurseâ€™s entire client list. We expect the relevance and accuracy of the data to improve over time as the nurses gain experience and efficiency in using the documentation system and utilization of the EDS increases.

--     â€¢	Every client does not necessarily need or receive a comprehensive assessment. Problems, Interventions and Nurse-reported Outcomes are not done or documented for every client. Therefore, these reported findings represent the percentage of clients for whom Problems, Interventions and Outcomes were assessed and documented, not the percentage of ALL clients. Like the other findings, this data cannot be generalized to ALL clients enrolled in your Community or Parish Nurse program.
