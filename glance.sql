-- SQL Script to generate the "At A Glance" (AAG) report.
-- Table   from redcap_export is assumed to have been imported from a CSV export of the REDCap database.
-- Table aag_town is manually populated to contain a list of towns included in the report.
-- Table aag_date_range is manually populated to contain an inclusive range of dates for the report.

.width 180
-- .mode colum seems to be the only thing that really works
-- unfortunately, .width 180 seems to pad to 180.
-- Based on the SQLite3 documentation, .width 0 should work, but it
-- seems to mess up some queries.  Why?
