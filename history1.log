    Correctec outcomes to include 6 month report and rename view.

    Refactored aag1_encounter_all view
    
    Re-written view view takes into account that the user might select more than one method for a contact, and we mostly count each selected method as a different encounter.  Despite this complex change, the counts only changed slightly, which is a very good thing!
